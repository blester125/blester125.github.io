# https://blester125.com

My personal site hosted on github pages. Supports HTTPs and uses a custom domain for `blester125.com` and `www.blester125/com`.

Publications and blog entries are populated automatically from bibtext and json files respectivly. The header and footer are shared and loaded dynamically on the page. The blog tag index page is generated dynamically based on the blog posts that have been created. Given that this is all github pages, everything dynamic is a mix of JQuery and Vue.js.

See the Wiki for notes on deployment, debugging, and extensions.
