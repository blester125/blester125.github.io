# https://blester125.com

My personal site hosted on github pages. Supports HTTPs and uses a custom domain for `blester125.com` and `www.blester125.com`.

Publications and blog entries are populated automatically from a combination of bibtex and json files. The header and footer are shared and loaded dynamically on the page. The blog tag index page is generated dynamically based on the blog posts that have been created. Given that this is all github pages, everything dynamic is a mix of JQuery and Vue.js. Citation counts are automatically pulled from Semantic Scholar.

See the Wiki for notes on deployment, debugging, and extensions.
