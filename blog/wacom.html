                >Smiling Friends</a
              ><a></a>, I decided to try my hand at animation. It is difficult
              to overstate just how bizarre the show is, but you can't help but
              watch and see how they really pulled out all the stops. There is
              normal 2D animation, 3D animation, a rotoscoped section, and even
              one of those super gross, painted, close-up shots you see
              sometimes in SpongeBob. There was even a character watching a live
              action clip on a tablet. I really recommend the show, but I
              totally understand if it turns out to be too weird for you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted indent">
              I've never been a very good artist and I definitely have never
              been able to draw consistently or quickly. Given that these are
              some of the first skills that come to mind mind when you think
              about animation, you might be wondering what is wrong with me. My
              real goal is just to be able to make something interesting and
              creative. I also hope that by picking 2D animation as a medium
              I'll be forced to learn these skills. At a minimum, I expect to
              get better at drawing circles, squares, and straight lines which
              should make the white board diagrams I make when explaining a
              complex algorithm a bit (or a lot?) easier to read.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted indent">
              To facilitate this, I got a drawing tablet. I went with a
              <a
                href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos"
                >Wacom Intuos Small</a
              ><a></a>. Given my skills on display here, it should be clear I'm
              not sponsored, this is just the tablet I got. It seems to work
              well as a first tablet that is on the cheaper side. The problem is
              that I use Linux as my daily driver and Wacom tablets aren't
              supported. I've put a decent amount of work into getting
              everything running smoothly and I wanted to share what I did here.

                hits the ground. It also has "Slow In, Slow Out" where the ball

                accelerates as it starts to fall back to earth.

          <h3>Setting up the Wacom Drivers</h3>

          <p class="text-muted">
            Unfortunately, Wacom tablets aren't supported on Linux. This means
            that there aren't official drivers published by Wacom to facilitate
            communication between the tablet and your computer. Luckily for us,
            there is a great community of people creating
            <a href="https://linuxwacom.github.io/">open source drivers</a
            ><a></a> for these tablets. Often these drivers ship with newer
            versions of Linux. I personally only had to install the
            <span class="tt">libwacom</span> package. I installed from source
            and their documentation was pretty detailed and made the process
            easy.
          </p>

          <h3>Configuring the Tablet with <span class="tt">xsetwacom</span></h3>

          <p class="text-muted">
            The nice people over at The Linux Wacom Project, who make the open
            source drivers, provide a handy tool,
            <span class="tt">xsetwacom</span>, designed to facilitate things
            like the configuration of the buttons that are commonly found on
            both the tablets and on the styluses themselves.
          </p>

          <h4>Configuring the Buttons</h4>

          <p class="text-muted">
            <span class="tt">xsetwacom</span> configures parts of the Wacom
            eco-system by natural name, rather than by an id or the like. The
            command <code>xsetwacom list</code> will return the name, id, and
            type (<span class="tt">ERASER</span>,
            <span class="tt">STYLUS</span>, <span class="tt">PAD</span>, etc.)
            of all the detected Wacom devices. We can use the
            <span class="tt">get</span> command to see the value of a setting.
            We normally see calls like
            <code>xsetwacom get "{device name}" {parameter}</code>. We can use
            <span class="tt">xsetwacom list parameters</span> to see all the
            set-able values. Once we decide on the value we set it like so
            <code>xsetwacom set "{device name}" {parameter} {value}</code>, for
            example,
            <code
              >xsetwacom set "Wacom Intuos S Pad pad" Button 1 "key ctrl
              z"</code
            >
            sets button one on the tablet so the "undo" hotkey.
          </p>

          <h4>Configuring the Available Writing Space</h4>

          <p class="text-muted">
            One quirk of Wacom tablets is that when you have multiple monitors
            the drawing surface defaults to mapping across all the available
            monitors. Touching on the left edge of the tablet jumps to the left
            edge of the left-most monitor, while the right edge would be all the
            way over on the right side of the right monitor. This often causes
            tiny movements on the pad to be a huge jump on the screen. We use
            the
            <span class="tt">MapToOutput</span> command to limit the drawing
            surface to a particular screen. You are supposed to be able to use
            the name of the display that you get back from
            <span class="tt">xrandr</span>, but that never worked for me. When
            this fails, you can use the index (starting from zero) of the screen
            when you consider the active screens. For example, I use
            <code
              >xsetwacom set "Wacom Intuos S Pen stylus" MapToOutput
              Head-0</code
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Re-configuration as you Remove and Plug-In the Tablet</h3>

          <p class="text-muted">
            The problem is that you'll need to re-configure your tablet each
            time you plug in your tablet or restart your computer. You can wrap
            up all your configuration in a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/blester125/dotfiles/blob/master/wacom/xsetwacom.sh"
              >script</a
            ><a></a> and run that like I did. However, this is still a manual
            process that I would personally forget to do all the time. Now we
            are going to look into how to do this automatically.
          </p>

          <h4>A Failed Attempt with <span class="tt">udev</span> Rules</h4>

          <p class="text-muted">
            Linux has a feature called <span class="tt">udev</span> rules. These
            are user defined actions that are triggered when new devices are
            plugged in. We can write a rule like
            <code
              >SUBSYTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="XXXX", ATTRS{idProduct} ==
              "YYYY", RUN+="/path/to/my/script"</code
            >
            to run a script when a usb device is plugged in with an vendor id of
            <span class="tt">XXXX</span> and a product id of
            <span class="tt">YYYY</span>.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted indent">
            My first thought was to run my setup script each time it detected
            that my tablet was plugged in. The problem was that for
            <span class="tt">xsetwacom</span> to work, the X server needs to
            have already detected and processed the tablet. This happens long
            after the <span class="tt">udev</span> rule fires. People online
            were working on trying to use sleeps to handle this. Your script
            would simply wait until the X server would have had time to find the
            tablet before we try to configure it. The problem was that you
            needed a wrapper around the configuration script. The wrapper would
            need to trigger the configuration script and run it in the
            background. This wrapper would then need to sleep and then configure
            the tablet. This extra layer of indirection is needed because if the
            configuration script was to sleep in the foreground it would block
            other things from running. If our script sleeping blocks the X
            server then it would have never detected our tablet and
            configuration would fail. This was getting far too complex and it
            seemed too brittle, so I want with a different solution.
          </p>

          <h4>Finding the vendor and product ids</h4>

          <p class="text-muted">
            Both the <span class="tt">udev</span> rule and my eventual solution
            require the vendor id and product id of the table. This can be
            gotten with <code>lsusb</code>. The output will look like
            <code>Bus 001 Device 006: ID 056a:0374 Wacom Co., Ltd</code> which
            you can interpret like so
            <code
              >Bus {bus_number} Device {device_number}: ID
              {vendor_id}:{product_id} {product_name}</code
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>A Long Running <span class="tt">udev</span> Listener Service</h3>

          <p class="text-muted">
            Instead of using <span class="tt">udev</span> rules, I wrote a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/blester125/dotfiles/blob/master/wacom/wacom-listener.py"
              >python script</a
            ><a></a> that listens to <span class="tt">udev</span> events. This
            is makes it easier to have sleeps to wait for X to detect the
            tablet. This script simply sits there and when a new device comes
            in, with a matching vendor id and product id, we trigger our
            configuration script. This script makes the tablet responsive to
            unplugging. Once you plug the tablet back in, it will get
            re-configured.
          </p>

          <h4>A Note on Dependency Management</h4>

          <p class="text-muted">
            My long running listener uses the
            <span class="tt">pyudev</span> library. There are a few ways to make
            this library accessible to the system service. I chose to install
            the library in a <span class="tt">pyenv</span> environment. In my
            listener script I point the <code>#!</code> line to the python
            binary for this environment. When we execute this script it uses
            this python interpreter. Other solutions would be to call the script
            through that interpreter manually.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <span class="tt">systemd</span> For Automatic Starts and Reloads on
            Failure
          </h3>

          <p class="text-muted">
            The long-running server method works well, but there is still the
            manual step of starting it every time you boot your computer and
            restarting it if it ever crashes. We can use
            <span class="tt">systend</span> to manage this service for us.

            This is our service configuration file&mdash;I've called it
            <code>wacom.service</code>. There are obvious values like
            <span class="tt">Description</span> which is the natural language
            summary of what your service does.
            <span class="tt">ExecStart</span> tells us how to run the service,
            while keys like <span class="tt">Restart</span> and
            <span class="tt">RestartSec</span> control the settings for which to
            restart the service.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted indent">
            One thing to point out is the line
            <code>Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code>. This sets an
            environment variable in the service. In this particular case, we are
            making the python output unbuffered. Normally python doesn't
            actually print the output(or write it to a file) until a
            <code>\n</code> is printed or the buffer files up. This environment
            variable makes it so we always output. This is needed to make the
            logging in the modules show up with
            <span class="tt">journalctl</span>.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted">
            The following steps are needed to enable the service.
          </p>

          <ol class="text-muted">
            <li>
              Copy the service file into <code>~/.config/systemd/user/</code>.
              Note that this needs to be a copy and not a soft link. When
              enabling the service a soft link will be created and will complain
              about having too many levels of soft lengths.
            </li>
            <li>Run <code>systemctl --user enable wacom.service</code></li>
            <li>Run <code>systemctl --user start wacom.service</code></li>
            <li>
              Run <code>systemctl --user status wacom.service</code> to monitor
              the health of the service
            </li>
            <li>
              We can stop the service with
              <code>systemctl --user stop wacom.serivce</code>, disable it with
              <code>systemctl --user disable wacom.service</code>, and if we
              change the service definition file we can reload the service with
              <code
                >systemctl --user daemond-reload && systemctl --user restart
                wacom.service</code
              >
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="text-muted">
            We can use <code>journalctl --user-unit wacom.service</code> to get
            the logs from the service.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted indent">
            Now <span class="tt">systemd</span> should manage starting our
            service on boot and restarting it should it crash. We can simulate a
            crash with
            <code>systemctl --user --signal=SIGKILL kill wacom.service</code>
            and see how <span class="tt">systemd</span> will bring it back up.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted indent">
            Note: For most of these commands we should be able to drop the
            <span class="tt">.service</span> suffix and just call is wacom when
            using <code>systemctl</code> commands.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted indent">
            Now this listener service should make it so that when we plug in the
            tablet our defaults should be loaded.

                A rolling eyes reaction I make with <a href="">OpenToonz</a>.
                It's the open source version of the software Studio Ghibli uses.
                I think I'm pretty close to Hayao Miyazaki level tbh.

              Hopefully this post can help someone who is trying setup their
              Wacom tablet on Ubuntu Linux. I'm still drawing poorly, but at
              least I can create my own reaction gifs now. I'm think I'm going
              to go draw a flower pot sliding across the floor to work on
              "overlapping action", "drag", and "follow though".
